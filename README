This Calculator is run by C#

I have tried to make it imposible to break, but my friend found out how to break it.
The only way I know of to break it is by typing Ctrl + C

This calculator can add, subtract, multiply, divide, calculate exponents, square root, add decimals, and subtract
decimals.

Note: This calculator cannot take numbers that are exesively massive.

I hope you find your answers to your math questions in this calculator.
